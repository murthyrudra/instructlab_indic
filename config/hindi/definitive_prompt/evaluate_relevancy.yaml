system: You are a very knowledgeable AI Assistant that will faithfully assist the user with their task.

introduction: |
  Your task is to assess the relevance of a given response to a specific query. This evaluation should be conducted methodically by answering two key questions:

principles: |
  1. Subject Matter Relevance: Does the provided response accurately match the subject matter of the user's query? This question aims to determine if the response is directly related to the main topic or issue presented in the query.
  2. Focus and Perspective Addressing: Does the provided response effectively address the focus or perspective on the subject matter as outlined in the user's query? This question seeks to evaluate whether the response not only matches the subject matter but also aligns with the specific angle or concern raised by the user.
  
  For each question, assign a score of 1 point if the response meets the criteria, and 0 points if it does not. After evaluating each question, provide detailed feedback explaining your reasoning behind the scores awarded.

  Conclude your evaluation with a final result, strictly using the following format: 'Total Score: X'. The total score should represent the sum of points assigned for each question, with a maximum possible score of 2 points.
  Only evaluate the response based on the above criteria, do not create new questions.

examples: |
  Example 1:
  [Start of Question]
  वह गुण क्या है जो किसी वस्तु को अन्य वस्तुओं को आकर्षित या विकर्षित करने की अनुमति देता है?
  [End of Question]

  [Start of Feedback]
  - Subject Matter Relevance Score: 1 (The response directly refers to the property of magnetism, which allows objects to attract or repel others.)
  - Alignment with Query's Focus Score: 1 (The response correctly names "चुम्बकत्व" as the property, addressing the query's focus on attraction/repulsion.)
  [End of Feedback]

  [Start of Feedback]
  - Subject Matter Relevance Score: 1 (The response relates to the composition of the iron pillar, mentioning the iron percentage.)
  - Alignment with Query's Focus Score: 0 (The response does not elaborate on how this composition affects the pillar's properties, missing a deeper perspective.)
  [End of Feedback]

  [Start of Score]
  1
  [End of Score]

  Example 3:
  [Start of Question]
  रक्त कोशिकाओं के तीन प्रकार कौन-कौन से हैं?

  [Start of Response]
  लाल रक्त कोशिकाएं शरीर में पोषक तत्वों का परिवहन करती हैं।

  - Alignment with Query's Focus Score: 0 (The response misses the focus of naming all three types of blood cells.)
  [End of Feedback]

  [Start of Score]
  0
  [End of Score]

generation: |
  Begin your response by providing the feedback followed by the score. Be as objective as possible.

  [Start of Question]
  {question}
  [End of Question]

  [Start of Response]
  {response}
  [End of Response]

  * Return the feedback within the [Start of Feedback] and [End of Feedback] tags.
  * Return the final score between [Start of Score] and [End of Score] tags.
start_tags: ["[Start of Feedback]", "[Start of Score]"]
end_tags: ["[End of Feedback]", "[End of Score]"]
