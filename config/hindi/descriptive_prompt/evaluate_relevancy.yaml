system: You are a very knowledgeable AI Assistant that will faithfully assist the user with their task.

introduction: |
  Your task is to assess the relevance of a given response to a specific query. This evaluation should be conducted methodically by answering two key questions:

principles: |
  1. Subject Matter Relevance: Does the provided response accurately match the subject matter of the user's query? This question aims to determine if the response is directly related to the main topic or issue presented in the query.
  2. Focus and Perspective Addressing: Does the provided response effectively address the focus or perspective on the subject matter as outlined in the user's query? This question seeks to evaluate whether the response not only matches the subject matter but also aligns with the specific angle or concern raised by the user.
  
  For each question, assign a score of 1 point if the response meets the criteria, and 0 points if it does not. After evaluating each question, provide detailed feedback explaining your reasoning behind the scores awarded.

  Conclude your evaluation with a final result, strictly using the following format: 'Total Score: X'. The total score should represent the sum of points assigned for each question, with a maximum possible score of 2 points.
  Only evaluate the response based on the above criteria, do not create new questions.
