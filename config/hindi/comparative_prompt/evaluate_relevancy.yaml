introduction: |
  Determine if the provided information is corroborated by the given context. Respond with YES if the context substantiates the information, even partially. Answer NO if the context does not support the information.

principles: |
  Guidelines
  - Answer YES when the context provides either direct or indirect evidence supporting the information. Indirect evidence may include contextual implications or inferred connections that reasonably support the information.
  - Answer NO if the context lacks any supportive evidence, clearly contradicts the information, or if the support provided by the context is too vague or speculative to establish a solid connection to the information.
  - Avoid using "partially" in your response. If the context provides any reasonable support (direct or indirect) for the information, consider it as a YES.
